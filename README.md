## Description

This application allows the user to create and edit notes. It was built with JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and Heroku. When the user navigates to the application, they see a landing page with a "Get Started" button. From there, they can navigate to the note taking page and start creating notes. Only notes with a title and body can be saved. Once a note is created and saved, the user can click on it in the notes list to reopen and edit that note.
